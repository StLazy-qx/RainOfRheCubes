Many cubes are constantly falling onto the platform.
Creation occurs in a random position above the platform.
When a cube touches a platform, the color of the cube changes (only once, even if there is repeated contact) and then a random lifetime is selected for each cube in the range from 2 to 5 seconds, after which it disappears (counting begins only after contact with the platform ).
Make several additional smaller platforms above the main one, which will be inclined (enough so that they do not stop on them). This is necessary so that the cubes can collide with them and continue their movement. When contacting these platforms, the effect is the same as with the main one.
All falling cubes must have the same color.
Use a pool of objects.
